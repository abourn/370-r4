# Being an Ethical Data Scientist

### Data Collection

An ethical data scientist understands the following about data collection:

1. The accuracy of collected data impacts subjects' lives.
2. Biases can misinform collection processes. 
3. Collection can be intrusive and "always costs someone something." (http://conflict.lshtm.ac.uk/page_13.htm#Ethical_Introduction)

In many ways, these values emobdy a common theme of understanding the impact of data collection on others.  A central component to ethically source data is to understand that collecting data produces not only the data itself, but impacts the subject(s) of data collection.  

This can be thought of as the notion that "data collection always costs someone something." In particular, data is used to drive conclusions and analysis, so an ethical data scientist must start with understanding the potential impact of faulty data collection.  

Simmons, et al. explain this possibility through highlighting the choices researchers must make during data collection: "Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared?
Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?"  According to their article, it is infeasible for researchers to answer these questions in the best way possible. Ultimately, according to the authors, this likely (and necessarily) leads to false-positive findings well over the stated 5% threshold.  

If poor decisions made about data collection produces conclusions that incorrectly model reality, then the associated benefits of scientific progress are lost, or can actually hurt the lives of associated stakeholders.  Take, for instance, a demographic analysis used to inform the distribution of funds for certain social programs (gross oversimplification of the issue, but useful for this example).  Say the researchers did not follow best practices for collecting the associated data,  (like asking their 5 best friends) and then concluded that the social programs were not beneficial to a community. That conclusion could be used to justify the axing of said programs.  However, those programs may very well have been beneficial and have a direct impact on people's lives.  Had the researchers collected the data ethically and accurately, then they would have concluded the same.
