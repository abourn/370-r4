# Being an Ethical Data Scientist

### Data Collection

An ethical data scientist understands the following about data collection:

1. The accuracy of collected data impacts subjects' lives.
2. Biases can misinform collection processes. 
3. Collection can be intrusive and "always costs someone something." (http://conflict.lshtm.ac.uk/page_13.htm#Ethical_Introduction)

In many ways, these values emobdy a common theme of understanding the impact of data collection on others.  A central component to ethically source data is to understand that collecting data produces not only the data itself, but impacts the subject(s) of data collection.  

This can be thought of as the notion that "data collection always costs someone something." In particular, data is used to drive conclusions and analysis, so an ethical data scientist must start with understanding the potential impact of faulty data collection.  

Simmons, et al. explain this possibility through highlighting the choices researchers must make during data collection: "Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared?
Which control variables should be considered? Should spe- cific measures be combined or transformed or both?"
