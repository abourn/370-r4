# Being an Ethical Data Scientist

### Data Collection

An ethical data scientist understands the following about data collection:

1. The accuracy of collected data impacts subjects' lives.
2. Biases can misinform collection processes. 
3. Collection can be intrusive and "always costs someone something." (http://conflict.lshtm.ac.uk/page_13.htm#Ethical_Introduction)

In many ways, these values emobdy a common theme of understanding the impact of data collection on others.  Data science can be a powerful tool that must be wielded appropriately and cautiously. 

A central component to ethically source data is to understand that collecting data produces not only the data itself, but a whole host of side affects.  The key to this concept is the notion that "data collection always costs someone something."
